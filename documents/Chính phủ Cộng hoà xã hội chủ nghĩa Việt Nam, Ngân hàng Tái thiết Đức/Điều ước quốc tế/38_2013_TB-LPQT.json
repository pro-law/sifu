style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Terms used herein and defined in the Agreement bear\nthe meanings therein ascribed to them, unless the context otherwise requires.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Accordingly, I am of the opinion that under the\nlaws of Vietnam as at the date hereof;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">1. The Borrower has the power and authority to\nenter into the Agreement and to borrow under the Agreement and has taken all\nnecessary legal actions to authorize such borrowing upon the terms and\nconditions of the Agreement and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance\nof the Agreement;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">2. The Agreement as signed by Mr. [Dr. Nguyen Thanh\nDo, General Director of the External Finance Department of the Ministry of\nFinance of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam], who was authorised by [HE Mr.\nMinister of Finance Vuong Dinh Hue], has been duly executed and constitutes\nlegally binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against it at law in\naccordance with its respective terms; (the signer will be determined later,\nthere may not be Mr. Nguyen Thanh Do)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">3.

Under the laws of Vietnam, the choice of the\nlaws of the Federal Republic of Germany to govern the Agreement is a valid\nchoice of law, provided that such application or the consequence thereof is not\ncontrary to the basic principles of the law of the Socialist Republic of\nVietnam. In my opinion the aforementioned condition is met.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">8. The waiver by the Borrower of any right of\nimmunity on grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from jurisdiction, attachment\n(before or after judgment) or execution as provided in Article 14.8 of the\nAgreement is valid.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">9.

The Borrower has the power and authority to enter into the Agreement and to borrow under the Agreement and has taken all necessary legal actions to authorize such borrowing upon the terms and conditions of the Agreement and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement;\n\n2\\. The Agreement as signed by Mr. \\[Dr. Nguyen Thanh Do, General Director of the External Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\\], who was authorised by \\[HE Mr. Minister of Finance Vuong Dinh Hue\\], has been duly executed and constitutes legally binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against it at law in accordance with its respective terms; (the signer will be determined later, there may not be Mr. Nguyen Thanh Do)\n\n3\\. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by the Borrower and the borrowing under the Agreement, at the date of issuance of this legal opinion, do not violate any provision of the laws and regulations of Vietnam.\n\n4\\. Every consent, license, approval or authorization of any governmental authority or agency required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, legality, validity or enforceability of the Agreement and the borrowing under the Agreement (including the obtaining and transference of all amounts due under the Agreement)have been duly obtained and are in full force and effect;\n\n5\\. The obligations of the Borrower under the Agreement constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable, direct and unconditional obligations of the Borrower and rank and will rank at least pari passu with all present unsecured indebtedness and contingent liabilities of the Borrower;\n\n6\\. The submission by the Borrower to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement between KfW and the Borrower pursuant to Article \\[14.9\\] of the Agreement is valid under the laws of Vietnam;\n\n7\\. Under the laws of Vietnam, the choice of the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to govern the Agreement is a valid choice of law, provided that such application or the consequence thereof is not contrary to the basic principles of the law of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In my opinion the aforementioned condition is met.\n\n8\\. The waiver by the Borrower of any right of immunity on grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from jurisdiction, attachment (before or after judgment) or execution as provided in Article 14.8 of the Agreement is valid.\n\n9\\. All payments to be made by the Borrower on the basis of the Agreement shall be made without withholding or reduction for any Taxes or Documentary Taxes in accordance with the double taxation treaty between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Federal Republic of Germany dated November 6th 1995.\n\n10\\. Any final and conclusive award obtained in the arbitral tribunal stipulated in the Agreement shall be recognized and enforced in accordance with the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Vietnam Civil Procedure Code.\n\nThis opinion is limited to matters of Vietnam. We express no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction. This opinion is given solely for the purpose of the Agreement and may not be used for any other purpose.\n\n**Yours faithfully,  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nLE THANH LONG  \nDEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE  \nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM**",
